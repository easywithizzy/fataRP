# ESX_GSR - v1.1
**Version:** 1.1
**Created by:** BenZoN for DanishRP


**Requirements esx_gsr**
[es_extended](https://github.com/ESX-Org/es_extended)
[pNotify](https://github.com/Nick78111/pNotify)

**Description**
This script will allow players with the "police" job to run a GSR (gun shot residue) test to see if a player has shot a gun within a certain amount of time.

Difference of Radiant GSR Test and ESX_GSR is that ESX_GSR dos not use MySQL to save the GSR data, and there is a couple of extra configuration options ex. (you can now set the amount of time the player needs to be in water to wash off the gsr)

**Features**
- Will auto count down the timer in the database and will delete the entry once the timer is over.
- If you shoot again while you are already in the database, it will restart the timer again.
- Auto deletes entry from the database when the player disconnects.
- Auto clear the database table on server restart/start.
- Current timer set to about 60 minutes (1 Hour) I believe

**Installation esx_gsr**
- Download - https://github.com/BattleRattt/Radiant_gsrtest/archive/master.zip
- Put it in the `[esx]` directory
- Add this to your  `server.cfg`:
```
start esx_gsr
```

**Integration with esx_policejob**

**Find.**
```
local elements = {
	{label = _U('id_card'),			value = 'identity_card'},
	{label = _U('search'),			value = 'body_search'},
	{label = _U('handcuff'),		value = 'handcuff'},
	{label = _U('drag'),			value = 'drag'},
	{label = _U('put_in_vehicle'),	value = 'put_in_vehicle'},
	{label = _U('out_the_vehicle'),	value = 'out_the_vehicle'},
	{label = _U('fine'),			value = 'fine'},
	{label = _U('unpaid_bills'),	value = 'unpaid_bills'},
```
Insert
```
	{label = "GSR Test",			value = 'gsr_test'}
```

**So you get something like.**
```
local elements = {
	{label = _U('id_card'),			value = 'identity_card'},
	{label = _U('search'),			value = 'body_search'},
	{label = _U('handcuff'),		value = 'handcuff'},
	{label = _U('drag'),			value = 'drag'},
	{label = _U('put_in_vehicle'),	value = 'put_in_vehicle'},
	{label = _U('out_the_vehicle'),	value = 'out_the_vehicle'},
	{label = _U('fine'),			value = 'fine'},
	{label = _U('unpaid_bills'),	value = 'unpaid_bills'},
	{label = "GSR Test",			value = 'gsr_test'}
```

**Then abit below find.**
```
elseif action == 'unpaid_bills' then
	OpenUnpaidBillsMenu(closestPlayer)
```

**After that insert.**
```
elseif action == 'gsr_test' then
	TriggerServerEvent('esx_gsr:Check', GetPlayerServerId(closestPlayer))
```

**So it looks like this.**
```
elseif action == 'unpaid_bills' then
	OpenUnpaidBillsMenu(closestPlayer)
elseif action == 'gsr_test' then
	TriggerServerEvent('esx_gsr:Check', GetPlayerServerId(closestPlayer))
end
```
